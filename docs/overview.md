# dscollections Overview

`dscollections` is designed to provide a high-quality learning and utility package for common DSA patterns:

- Type-safe implementations using Python generics.
- Clear error semantics (`IndexError`, `KeyError`) for invalid operations.
- Focused API design for educational and practical use.

## Design Principles

1. **Predictable behavior** over clever shortcuts.
2. **Strong readability** through docstrings and explicit naming.
3. **Pragmatic scope**: foundational structures that are commonly needed.
